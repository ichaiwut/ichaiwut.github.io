I am a Front-end Trooper at [BUZZWOO!](https://buzzwoo.de)

My name is TingSter. I am a web designer and front-end developer, as well as a web developer too. I love coding JavaScript, CSS and PHP of course. I was born and live in Chiang Mai

### PROGRAMMING

I work at a Senior front-end developer at Buzzwoo! we planning, coding, analyzing, and testing with a high level of skill to make the awesome thing happen on this planet!

### MOBILE

Of cause, the website has to display on mobile with good performance and speed. Progressive Web App (WPA) is a new thing to make your website like an application. The hybrid app is another way to build the mobile app one code runs any platform. So all above create by JavaScript ;-)

### Ja

This website is compatible with Github pages, in fact even this site itself is created with Github Pages and hosted with Github.
